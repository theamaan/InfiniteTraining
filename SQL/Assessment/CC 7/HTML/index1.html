    <h1>The below is the document which needs to be corrected</h1>

    <p><strong>Dihydrogen Monoxide</strong> <em>(also known as hydroxyl acid or DHMO<sup>1</sup>)</em>, is a dangerous
        substance that<sup>2</sup>: is the major component of acid rain, contributes to the greenhouse effect, may cause
        severe burns, is fatal if inhaled, contributes to the erosion of our natural landscape, accelerates corrosion
        and rusting of many metals, may cause electrical failures and decreased effectiveness of automobile brakes, and
        has been found in excised tumors of terminal cancer patients. Despite the danger, DHMO is often used: as an
        industrial solvent and coolant, in nuclear power plants in the production of Styrofoam<sup>TM</sup>, as a fire
        retardant, in many forms of cruel animal research, as an additive in certain junk-foods and other food products,
        in the distribution of pesticides. Even after washing, produce remains contaminated by this chemical.</p>

    <p><sup>1</sup>The more common chemical formula is H<sub>2</sub>O. <sup>2</sup>Source: Coalition to Ban Dihydrogen
